# Pixel Art Maker Project :art:

This a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a canvas.
The starter code (HTML and CSS) was provided to build the application. I wrote the JavaScript code which allows users to create a grid of squares and apply colors to those squares to create digital pixel art. <br>

Users should be able to:
1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with a color.<br>

## Skills Gained From This Project

Overall, I learned and mastered the following JavaScript skills by completing this project: <br>

1. Defining variables with const and let.
2. Accessing and interacting with the DOM by using document object methods.
3. Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects (event listeners).
4. Calling preventDefault() to cancel an event. 
5. Writing nested for loops and using for loop variables.
